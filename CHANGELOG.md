# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow semver once 1.0 is tagged. The running version is shown in the apps (Settings, admin header), by `syntaxis version` and at `/api/version`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Interactive terminal tab in the session view, running in the session's own sandbox, with an admin switch per user.
- Live progress line while a run is working: waiting, connecting, loading the model, reading, thinking, replying, running a command.
- CPU metering with a daily compute allowance, a Resources tab (typical and busiest-10% CPU, memory), and throttling, pausing and stopping of sustained load.
- Copy buttons on code blocks and command output.
- Build information (version, commit, date) in the binary, the apps, `/healthz` and `/api/version`.
- MCP servers, each in its own gVisor sandbox, with registry browsing and admin approval.

### Changed
- Secrets are read fresh for every command, so adding, changing or removing one applies immediately instead of needing a new session.
- Simpler getting started guide and README.

### Fixed
- Chat jitter while a reply streamed (only the chat log scrolls now).
- Admin Benchmarks and MCP tabs were not reachable from the navigation.
- Sandbox DNS on Docker releases that cannot mount a single file from a volume subpath.
- Several accessibility issues: badge contrast, heading order, keyboard-focusable scroll areas, icons that failed to render.
